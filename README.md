# flutter-without-android-studio
this is a step by step documentation on how to use flutter from scratch without android studio

**DISCLAIMER:** this method meant for those who have very low-end PCs and those who love playing with command-line tools, if you can't find yourself there i highly encourge you to stop here and use the official and the well-supported Android Studio method.

## What do we need?
* **android-sdk** package (from your repo package manager for example) to provide the basic directory structure, for ubuntu users you can use aptitude to install it `sudo apt install android-sdk`
* [sdkmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager) download it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) and seach for `command-line-tools` 
* **Flutter-sdk** download it from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#get-sdk) 
* [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) / [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) or [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) or any text editor of your choise, i will use neovim as my text-editor, but you don't really have to
* For (neo)vim users i recommend installing [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) then [coc-flutter](https://github.com/iamcco/coc-flutter) very useful plugins while dealing with flutter
